Practice of Fundamentals of CPP From Scratch

# 09132021
I made 5 different tasks in 1 hour. This was to learn basic board creation and manipulation. I was able to print the board, then print a new board with a character of my choice, then print a new board and change a single cell with a char of my choice. Then I went back and changed the print and change boards to be able to make custom rows and columns. These weren't too difficult, but were still fairly challenging for someone who doesn't know how to code from scratch (I usually follow books and tutorials, which puts me in Limbo). My biggest issue were arrays, just setting them up and finding their length, anyway. Next Task is to try to make a simple, two player tic tac toe game.
